Chocolate chips cookies
Ingredients
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips


Instructions-

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then add the vanilla extract. Mix well until fully combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may appear slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Once cooled, serve and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!

Tips-

extra touch of flavor, add 1 cup of chopped nuts (such as walnuts or pecans) to the dough along with the chocolate chips.
Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.
Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of cold milk or a cup of hot coffee!
